# YB TRACKER — SESSION-LOG

Append-only journal. Newest at top. Bootstrap reads the last ~3 blocks (per HANDOFF.md).
Every block: what shipped, dated facts (with evidence), observed preferences, open threads, retired facts.
This file was referenced by the bootstrap but did not exist until 13/07/2026 — created to close the broken pointer.

## 2026-07-17 — v931 / AS v204: expense-delete + rollup integrity (Cowork)
SHIPPED:
- AS v204 DEPLOYED (deployment Version 334, same /exec AKfycbxqbXKwg-…). `_syncExpenseRollup(ss,jobId,client,title)` top-level = single source of truth for the client-sheet `הוצאות <title>` rollup line. deleteExpense now calls it (FIXES the billing bug: deletes never synced the rollup → clients may have been billed for deleted expenses). createExpenseRow now idempotent (was: appended a DUPLICATE rollup line every run). Rollup rows carry `SRC:<jobId>` back-ref in notes col. Price-only updates (preserve profit formulas). New `repairExpenseRollups(dryRun)` — dry-run by default.
- HTML v931 DEPLOYED (built on live v929, byte-verified base). ✕ delete button in Monthly Expenses report with two-tap arm (✕→red מחק?→confirm), mandatory `_loadMonthlyExpenses()` re-fetch after delete (deleteRow shifts rows). No console errors; ✕ + handler confirmed in live source.
FACT (all 17/07/26):
- Live AS v203 in the editor was NOT byte-identical to the repo/claude-builds v203 base — another session had edited live (the archived "PO v4: capture quantity + unit price + line total" work near addPONewRow, ~+247 chars, uncommitted). PRESERVED it by applying my 6 edits IN-PLACE to live (fetched pairs.json from repo → decode → replace → setValue), not by overwriting with my base+edits. Mechanism proven: same pairs applied to fetched base reproduce committed v204 byte-for-byte. | evidence: SHA compares + 0 monaco error markers
- createExpenseRow (v203) appended the rollup line UNCONDITIONALLY (no locate-existing rule, rollup id is a throwaway EX####, not the source jobId). So the spec's `_syncExpenseRollup` "use createExpenseRow's locate rule" was impossible as written — redesigned with a SRC back-ref. | evidence: read createExpenseRow in full
- Spec was authored in the v923/v924 era; live had advanced to v929 (+ an undeployed v930 build). Version numbers in specs go stale fast across parallel sessions — always derive live. | evidence: browser title v929, claude-builds/v930 exists
- javascript_tool on the live github.io app runs in an ISOLATED world (page globals like SHEETS_URL read undefined) — do NOT use `typeof <global>` to verify deploys; grep the fetched source instead. | evidence: SHEETS_URL/showToast both undefined on a working app
PREFERENCE:
- 17/07/26 | "go. with it" = proceed with my stated recommendation (design A + separate handling of the pending build), not a blank check. | seen this session
OPEN:
- ⚠️ ACCEPTANCE TEST NOT RUN — the 5-step test mutates real client billing sheets; needs Yaniv to designate a scratch job/client (or run it himself). Code is deployed & audited but not yet functionally exercised on live data.
- ⚠️ repairExpenseRollups(false) NOT RUN — legacy client sheets likely hold duplicate/stale `הוצאות` lines (from the old unconditional-append bug) + delete-drift. Run `repairExpenseRollups(true)` first (dry-run, reads Logger), review, then `repairExpenseRollups(false)`.
- Repo apps-script-v204.js mirror = base+edits; DEPLOYED = base+edits+PO-v4 (the preserved 247-char change). Reconcile the mirror next session by pulling live and re-committing. Repo apps-script-v203.js is also the pre-PO-v4 base.
- Pending undeployed v930 build in claude-builds = "💰 הצעה" note→quote feature, built on v929. Since live is now v931, v930 must be REBASED onto v931 before it can deploy without reverting the expense-delete work.
RETIRED:
- "createExpenseRow appends one rollup line and has an append-vs-skip locate rule" — FALSE; it appends unconditionally (no locate). Killed 17/07/26.

## 2026-07-13 — Trust-boundary + memory wiring (Cowork session)
SHIPPED:
- Created this SESSION-LOG.md (bootstrap pointer was dangling).
- Added root CLAUDE.md so Claude Code auto-load fires the existing 3-read bootstrap.
- Added memory/tombstones.md consolidating known falsified facts.
- APPLIED the calibrated .claude/settings.local.json (backup: settings.local.json.bak-2026-07-13). Dropped standing grants: `gh api *`, `python3 -`, `python3 -c ' *`, `cd /tmp *`, `javascript_tool`; collapsed 8 duplicate curls into one scoped pattern.
FACT:
- 2026-07-13 | The Claude Code allowlist had grown by habit: 8 near-duplicate scanPOEmails curls + one-off cp/mkdir, plus wildcards `gh api *`, `python3 -`, `python3 -c ' *`, and `javascript_tool` | evidence: read .claude/settings.local.json | conf:0.95
- 2026-07-13 | HANDOFF.md migration from Drive is DONE (exists, dated 12/07, "promoted from MASTER HANDOFF v2") — the old session's last open thread is closed | evidence: read HANDOFF.md | conf:0.95
PREFERENCE:
- 2026-07-13 | Runs recurring harness meta-audits (Bitter Lesson -> Identity -> Memory -> Trust boundary); wants rigor + a durable artifact each time | seen:>=4 (folder docs) | conf:0.85
SHIPPED (cont.):
- Disconnected "Control your Mac" (osascript) and "Desktop Commander" via Settings -> Connectors [13/07/26].
OPEN:
- Cloudflare: still connected; treat `*_delete` verbs as ask-each-time (not yet scoped).
- Optional: authorize read-only connectors (github/notion/etc.) to cut re-derivation.
RETIRED:
- (none this session)
